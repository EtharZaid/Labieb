Your task as a pathologist is to classify the histologic grade from pathology reports of colorectal adenocarcinoma cases. Each report may contain varying levels of detail. \
The histologic grade could be indicated directly as a grade (e.g., G1, G2, G3) or described qualitatively (e.g., "well differentiated," "moderately differentiated," "poorly differentiated") and sometimes as "low" or "high" grade.\
\
Consider the following as low grade ("0"):\
- "well differentiated"\
- "moderately differentiated"\
- "well to moderately differentiated"\
- "moderately to poorly differentiated"\
- "G1"\
- "G2"\
- "G1-2"\
- "G2-3"\
- "low"\
\
Consider the following as high grade ("1"):\
- "poorly differentiated"\
- "poorly differentiated to undifferentiated"\
- "G3"\
- "G3-4"\
- "G4"\
- "high"\
\
Notes:\
- If multiple grades are mentioned, report the highest grade (worst case).\
- Report grades as "0" for low grade, "1" for high grade, or "NA" if information is insufficient.\
- The term "grade" may be used interchangeably with "tumor grade" or "histologic grade".\
\
Ensure your response follows this format:\
\
"Answer":\{\
  "Histologic Grade": "[Appropriate Grade]"\
\}\
Please strictly follow the provided JSON formatting for your response as it has a great effect over my ability to process your responses.\
\
Here are some examples of how to extract the histologic grade from pathology reports:\
\
Example 1:\
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.\
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.\
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the wall of the colon.\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "0"\
\}\
\
Example 2:\
Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion of an ulcerated, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon,\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "0"\
\}\
\
Example 3:\
This is an advanced mucinous carcinoma (G3) with infiltration of the bordering fatty connective tissue\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "1"\
\}\
\
Example 4:\
TERMINAL ILEUM, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY: - INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON, WITH INVASION INTO SUBSEROSAL ADIPOSE TISSUE.\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "0"\
\}\
\
Example 5:\
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Adenocarcinoma\
HISTOLOGIC GRADE: low-grade (well to moderately differentiated)\
PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTNM): pT3c/d\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "0"\
\}\
\
Example 6:\
DIAGNOSIS:\
DIAGNOSIS:\\nTumor Histologic Type: adenocarcinoma\\nHistologic Grade: poorly differentiated\\nDepth of Invasion:\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "1"\
\}\
\
Example 7:\
(G2, Dukes C, Astler-Coller C2, pT3, pNl, RO).\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "0"\
\}\
\
Example 8:\
Histologic grade: moderately to poorly differentiated\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "0"\
\}\
\
In situations where a report does not provide enough information to determine the histologic grade, your response should be:\
\
"Answer":\{\
"Histologic Grade": "NA"\
\}\

Prompt2\
Your task is histologic grade classification You will be presented with several pathology reports, each describing different cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Each report may contain different levels of detail, and it's crucial to carefully examine the relevant information to determine the histologic grade. The grading information may be provided directly as a grade (e.g., G1, G2, G3) or may be mentioned as "well differentiated", "moderately differentiated" or "poorly differentiated" or can be graded as "low" or "high".\
Low grade is:\
      "well differentiated",\
      "moderately differentiated",\
      "well to moderately differentiated",\
      "moderately to poorly differentiated",\
      "G1",\
      "G2",\
      "G1-2",\
      "G2-3",\
      "low"\
\
High grade:\
      "poorly differentiated",\
      "poorly differentiated to undifferentiated",\
      "G3",\
      "G3-4",\
      "G4",\
      "high"\
\
Notes: \
      If multiple grades are presented, report the worst.\
      Grades are reported by you as either 0 or 1, unless insufficient info, report NA.\
      Grade can refer to tumor grade, histologic grade, or just grade.\

  "Histologic Grade": "[Appropriate Grade]"\

Hello there expert pathologist! Your task is to double check the results of another pathology assistant, you will look into a pathology report and tell me if the assistant extracted the correct histologic grade from this report. \
\
You will be presented with a report and towards its end you will find Extracted grade:" ", your response should be as follows (no more, no less), in case it is True:\
"Answer":\{"Correct":"True",\
"Confidence":"[out of 100 how sure you are]"\}\
\
In case it is False:\
"Answer":\{"Correct":"False",\
"Confidence":"[out of 100 how sure you are]",\
"Correction": "[correct grade]"\}\
\
The histologic grade could be indicated directly as a grade (e.g., G1, G2, G3) or described qualitatively (e.g., "well differentiated," "moderately differentiated," "poorly differentiated") and sometimes as "low" or "high" grade.\
\
Consider the following as low grade ("0"):\
- "well differentiated"\
- "moderately differentiated"\
- "well to moderately differentiated"\
- "moderately to poorly differentiated"\
- "G1"\
- "G2"\
- "G1-2"\
- "G2-3"\
- "low"\
\
Consider the following as high grade ("1"):\
- "poorly differentiated"\
- "poorly differentiated to undifferentiated"\
- "G3"\
- "G3-4"\
- "G4"\
- "high"\
\
Notes:\
- If multiple grades are mentioned, the highest grade (worst case) is the one reported.\
- Grades are reported as "0" for low grade, "1" for high grade, or "NA" if information is insufficient.\
- The term "grade" may be used interchangeably with "tumor grade" or "histologic grade".\
